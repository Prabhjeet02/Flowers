Hii my name is prabhjeet singh.

I created the project named Flowers. on 12/10/2022 at 1020am.
After creating the project I run it.

1023..it showed can't reach the page. so I commented the ssl port and run it again...  hurrey.. it worked.

1041...  added the link for About Us page in the navigation.

1108.. added AboutUs.CSHTML PAGE and modified it. and added contollers in home controllers.cs..
run the page and got the page.

1221... i added about product page and added to navigation..and also added flower.cs file
and added attributes... happy because every thing is working good till now.  :)

14oct 1021... added migration but got error :(

1102... did some changes in startup.cs file and fixed an error which was creating the problem for migration.. 
and after doing migration Add-Migration InitialCreate and updated the database by the command Update-Database.

1115.. i wrote spelling wrong for quality so i changed it in all the file and in the files which was 
added by add migration but that was giving me error because 
the file in which i changed the spelling was created automatically by 
the application and i should not have changed it :( or seen the spelling before
and here i was felling regret :-((((...shittt.

1130.. i did Add-Migration InitialCreate2 and updated the Update-Database.

like name, color, price and some others that yoy can see in my project.  ;-)
